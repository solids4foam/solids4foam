## Section Aims

- This document describes the `solids4foam` utilities located in `applications/utilities`;
- Utilities are executables that provide various pre and post-processing functionalities;
- These `solids4foam` utilities provide functionalities not available in the standard `OpenFOAM` utilities ([OpenFOAM-wiki](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_OFUtilities)).

---

## `abaqusMeshToFoam`

- __Utility purpose__
  Mesh converter: converts [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) mesh (in `*.inp` format) into the FOAM mesh format.  
  Currently, this utility only supports 3-D hexahedral cells/elements.
  Details regarding the FOAM mesh format can be found, for example, [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.1-mesh-description#:~:text=By%20default%20OpenFOAM%20defines%20a,any%20restriction%20on%20its%20alignment.).  
  Note that each distribution of `OpenFOAM` comes with a set of mesh converters (but not for Abaqus), see the available one [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.5-mesh-conversion).  
  
- __Arguments__

  - `<mesh.inp>` name of the Abaqus mesh file.

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__
  ```bash
  $ abaqusMeshToFoam mesh.inp
  ```

  ```note
  - Only the following Abaqus element types are supported: C3D8 and C3D8R.  
  - Only the first PART is used and the rest are ignored. 
  - Node sets, element sets and surfaces are not converted. 
  ```

## `addTinyPatch`

- __Utility purpose__
  For a chosen patch, find the closest face to the specified location and separate it into a new patch.   
  The utility can be used, for example, to create patches for specifying point loads.

- __Arguments__

  - `<currentPatchName>` chosen patch name;
  - `<newTinyPatchName>` name of the one-face patch to be created;
  - `"(x y z)"` location vector. 

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__
  ```bash
  $ addTinyPatch Top TopNew "(30 30 0)"
  ```

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <figcaption>
     <strong>addTinyPatch: top patch before and after adding one-face patch</strong>
    </figcaption>
</div>

```note
When using `addTinyPatch` the original mesh is overwritten!
```

## `foamMeshToAbaqus`

- __Utility purpose__
  Mesh converter: converts FOAM mesh into [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) mesh (`*.inp` format).
  Currently, this utility only supports 3-D hexahedral cells/elements.
  
- __Arguments__

  None

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ foamMeshToAbaqus
  ```

  Converted mesh is written to the`abaqusMesh.inp` file.     
  Creates a node set and and element set and a surface for each boundary  patch.  
  Also creates a element set for each material in the materials file (if it is exists).

  ```note
  - Only works for hexahedral cells as yet.
  - Created for Abaqus-6.9-2, but should work for new versions too. 
  ```

## `perturbMeshPoints`

- __Utility purpose__  
    Add a random perturbation to each mesh points. The perturbation of a point is calculated as a scale factor times the local minimum edge length.
    
    By default, boundary points are slide along the patch. Patches which should not move can be defined via the fixedPatches entry.
    
    Points on feature edges are not moved, where feature edges are defined by the minimum cosine angle (`minCos`).

    The inputs are defined in `$FOAM_CASE/system/perturbMeshPointsDict`, and consist of a seed (for the random number generator) and a scaling factor to scale the perturbations relative to the local minimum edge length. The scaling factor is a vector to allow different scalings in different directions; for example, for 2-D, the Z
    component should be set to 0.0.

    This utility is useful for creating distorted grids for testing discretisations.
    
- __Arguments__  
  None

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Dictionary__  
  Inputs are defined in dictionary named `perturbMeshPointsDict` and located in `system` directory:

  ```c++
  // Perturn by 30% of the local minimum edge length in the X, Y and Z directions
  scaleFactor (0.3 0.3 0.3);
  
  // Gaussian or uniform random distribution
  Gaussian    no;
  
  // Seed for random number generator
  seed        1;
  
  // Minimum cosine to find feature edges
  // Points on feature edges are not moved
  minCos      0.7;
  
  // Names of patches which should not be perturbed
  fixedPatches
  (
      // Add patch names here
  );
  ```

  The `Gaussian` distribution can only be used in combination with [OpenFOAM.com](https://www.openfoam.com/). 

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ perturbMeshPoints
  ```

  The figure below shows mesh before and after using `perturbMeshPoints` utility.

     <strong>perturbMeshPoints: mesh before and after point perturbation</strong>
    </figcaption>
</div>

```note
Perturbed mesh (`polyMesh`) is stored in the `0` directory and needs to be moved to `constant` before running the simulation!
```

## `splitPatch`

- __Utility purpose__
  Splits a patch into two patches by putting faces in the given bounding box in a new patch.

- __Arguments__
  None

- __Options/parameters__

  `-overwrite`  overwrite the original mesh when storing mesh after patch splitting.

- __Dictionary__
  ```c++
  patchToSplitName    Top;
  
  newPatchName        TopNew;
  
  boundBoxes
  (
      (0 0 0.01) (1 1 1)
  );
  ```

  - `patchToSplitName` is a name of the patch to be split;
  - `newPatchName`is the name of the splitted patch part;
  - `boundBoxes` is list of bounding boxes; each defined with two vectors:  `(xmin ymin zmin)` and `(xmax ymax zmax)`. Boundary patch faces inside this bounding box will be put in a new patch.    
    _Note:_ The face's centre point is tested to see if it is inside the bounding boxes!

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ splitPatch
  ```

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./images/splitPatch.png" alt="Image" width="800">
      <figcaption>
       <strong>splitPatch: top patch before and after split</strong>
      </figcaption>
  </div>

  ```note
  The mesh with the new patch is stored in a new time-step directory (`1` for example) and should be moved to the `constant` before running the simulation. Alternatively, the `-overwrite` option can be used to overwrite the original mesh.
  ```
