## Section Aims

- This document describes the `solids4Foam` utilities located in `applications/utilities`;
- Each version of the `OpenFOAM` comes with its own set of utilities, which can be found in the `$FOAM_UTILITIES` directory (type `util` in console). The list of available utilities can be found on the following links: [OpenFOAM.com](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/a-reference/a.2-standard-utilities), [OpenFOAM.org](https://doc.cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide-v8/standard-utilities), [OpenFOAM-wiki](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_OFUtilities);
- The utility is executable with the same name as the directory name where it is located and is run simply by typing its name in the console with corresponding arguments/parameters if any.

## `abaqusMeshToFoam`

- __Utility purpose__
  Mesh converter; converts [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) mesh (in `*.inp` format) into the FOAM mesh format.  
  Details regarding the FOAM mesh format can be found, for example, [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.1-mesh-description#:~:text=By%20default%20OpenFOAM%20defines%20a,any%20restriction%20on%20its%20alignment.).  
  Note that each distribution of `OpenFOAM` comes with a set of mesh converters, see the available one [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.5-mesh-conversion).  

- __Arguments__

  - `<mesh.inp>` name of the Abaqus mesh file.

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__
  ```bash
  $ abaqusMeshToFoam mesh.inp
  ```

  ```Note
  - Only the following element types are supported: C3D8 and C3D8R.  
  - Only the first PART is used and the rest are ignored. 
  - Node sets, element sets and surfaces are not converted. 
  ```

## `addTinyPatch`

- __Utility purpose__
  For a chosen patch, find the closest face to the specified location and separate it into a new patch.   
  The utility can be used, for example, for specifying point loads.

- __Arguments__

  - `<currentPatchName>` chosen patch name;
  - `<newTinyPatchName>` name of the newly created one-face patch;
  - `"(x y z)"` location vector. 

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__
  ```bash
  $ addTinyPatch Top TopNew "(30 30 0)"
  ```

    </figcaption>
</div>

```Note
When using `addTinyPatch` the original mesh is overwritten!
```

## `foamMeshToAbaqus`

- __Utility purpose__
  Mesh converter; converts FOAM mesh into [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) mesh (`*.inp` format).   

- __Arguments__

  None

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ foamMeshToAbaqus
  ```

  Converted mesh is written to the`abaqusMesh.inp` file.     
  Creates a node set and and element set and a surface for each boundary  patch.  
  Also creates a element set for each material in the materials file (if it is exists).

  ```Note
  - Only works for hexahedral cells as yet.
  - Created for Abaqus-6.9-2, but should work for new versions too. 
  ```

## `perturbMeshPoints`

- __Utility purpose__  
  Add a random perturbation to each interior mesh point. Boundary points are perturbed only in case of `empty` or `wedge` patches.   
  The utility is used to create a distorted mesh to test the behavior of the discretisation procedure.

- __Arguments__  
  None

- __Options/parameters__

  None

- __Dictionary__  
  Inputs are defined in dictionary named `perturbMeshPointsDict` and located in `system` directory:

  ```c++
  seed        1;
  
  scaleFactor (5e-3 5e-3 5e-3);
  
  Gaussian    no;
  ```

  - `seed` is a scalar value used for the random number generator;
  - `scaleFactor` is a scaling vector which scales the point perturbation in each direction separately;
  - `Gaussian` enforces Gaussian distribution when perturbing points, otherwise uniform distribution is expected. Only used in combination with [OpenFOAM.com](https://www.openfoam.com/). 

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ perturbMeshPoints
  ```

  The figure below shows mesh before and after using `perturbMeshPoints` utility.

    <figcaption>
     <strong>perturbMeshPoints: mesh before and after point perturbation</strong>
    </figcaption>
</div>

```Note
Perturbed mesh (`polyMesh`) is stored in the `0` directory and needs to be moved to `constant` before running the simulation!
```

```Note
For 2D simulations, there is no need to perturb points in the `empty` direction. For an empty direction, zero scaling should be used, e.g.:  
`scaleFactor (5e-3 5e-3 0);`
```

## `splitPatch`

- __Utility purpose__
  Splits up a patch by putting faces in the given bounding box in a new patch.

- __Arguments__
  None

- __Options/parameters__

  `-overwrite`  overwrite the original mesh when storing mesh after patch splitting.

- __Dictionary__
  ```c++
  patchToSplitName    Top;
  
  newPatchName        TopNew;
  
  boundBoxes
  (
      (0 0 0.01) (1 1 1)
  );
  ```

  - `patchToSplitName` is a name of the patch to be split;
  - `newPatchName`is the name of the splitted patch part;
  - `boundBoxes` is list of bounding boxes; each defined with two vectors:  `(xmin ymin zmin)` and `(xmax ymax zmax)`. Boundary patch faces inside this bounding box will be put in a new patch.    
    _Note:_ The face's centre point is tested to see if it is inside the bounding boxes!

- __Example of usage__

  ```bash
  $ splitPatch
  ```

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./images/splitPatch.png" alt="Image" width="800">
      <figcaption>
       <strong>splitPatch: top patch before and after split</strong>
      </figcaption>
  </div>

  ```Note
  The mesh with the new patch is stored in a new time-step directory (`1` for example) and should be moved to the `constant` before running the simulation. Alternatively, the `-overwrite` option can be used to overwrite the original mesh.
  ```
