# Optional fixes for the OpenFOAM installation

As described below, there are different optional fixes depending on whether you
are using OpenFOAM.org, OpenFOAM.com, or foam-extend.

## OpenFOAM.org

- `GeometricField.C`: this fix is required for consistent time discretisation.
  Some FSI cases may crash without this fix.

- `backwardDdtScheme.C`: this corrects the scheme for a moving mesh, for
  example, for the fluid domain in a fluid-solid interaction simulation.

## OpenFOAM.com

- `backwardDdtScheme.C`: this corrects the scheme for a moving mesh, for
  example, for the fluid domain in a fluid-solid interaction simulation.

## foam-extend

- `EulerDdtScheme.C`: This corrects the scheme for a moving mesh, for example,
  for the fluid domain in a fluid-solid interaction simulation.

- `GeometricField.C`: this fix is required for consistent time discretisation.
  Some FSI cases may crash without this fix.

- `meshObjectBase.H`: without this fix, all runs will end in a segmentation. The
  solids4foam solver will work correctly; however, you may like to fix this if
  you plan to catch the return valve from the solver.

- `pointBoundaryMesh.C`: without this fix, cases involving topological mesh
  changes will have a segmentation fault. For example, when using
  `crackerFvMesh`.
