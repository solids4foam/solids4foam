# Summary

`solids4foam` is a toolbox designed for conducting solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction simulations within the widely-used OpenFOAM software [@OpenFOAM.com; @OpenFOAM.org; @foam-extend]. The toolbox has a comprehensive set of features, including advanced algorithms for fluid-solid and thermo-fluid-solid coupling, a variety of solid material models, non-trivial solid boundary conditions, and numerous discretisation and solution methods for solid mechanics.


The `solids4foam` toolbox is one of the most comprehensive solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction toolboxes available within OpenFOAM, having evolved from the `solidMechanics` and `extend-bazaar/FluidSolidInteraction` toolboxes of the foam-extend community [@foam-extend].
Several other OpenFOAM-based toolboxes provide capabilities for solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction, including `FOAM-FSI` [@Mehl2016], `miniGeotechFoam` [@Tang2015], `explicitSolidDynamics` [@Haider2019, @Haider2017, @Haider2018], as well as more specialised solvers such as the membrane fluid-solid interaction solver [@Wagner2022], a coupled actuator line and finite element analysis tool [@Schmitt2022], and a modular multiphysics framework [@StOnge2023].
However, many of these toolboxes are no longer actively maintained and lack the broad range of solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction features required for general-purpose simulations. Beyond OpenFOAM-based solutions, preCICE [@Chourdakis2023] provides an alternative approach by coupling OpenFOAM with widely-used finite element solvers such as deal.II [@Arndt2021], CalculiX [@Dhondt2004], FEniCS [@Logg2012], and Code_Aster [@codeAster], enabling flexible multiphysics simulations.
While `solids4foam` is among the first general finite volume-based toolboxes for solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction, established finite element-based codes such as FEniCS [@Logg2012] and deal.II [@Arndt2021] offer comparable functionality but differ in their numerical methodology.
Furthermore, domain-specific fluid-solid interaction solvers, such as SimVascular [@Zhu2022] and Ambit [@Hirschvogel2024] for cardiovascular simulations or turtlefluid-solid interaction [@Bergersen2020] for general monolithic fluid-solid interaction problems, provide specialised solutions for particular applications.
Despite these alternatives, `solids4foam` remains a uniquely positioned toolbox within OpenFOAM, offering a well-maintained and feature-rich platform for solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction simulations based on the finite volume method.


# Statement of Need

The `solids4foam` toolbox addresses four primary needs within the OpenFOAM community:

1. The need to perform fluid-solid interactions within OpenFOAM.
2. The need to solve complex solid mechanics problems directly within OpenFOAM.
3. The necessity for a modular approach to coupling various solid and fluid processes in OpenFOAM.
4. The demand for an extendable framework to facilitate research into innovative finite volume methods for solid mechanics.

The design of `solids4foam` adheres to four guiding principles:

1. **Usability:** If you can use OpenFOAM, you can use `solids4foam`.
2. **Compatibility:** Supports the three main OpenFOAM forks: OpenFOAM.com, OpenFOAM.org, and foam-extend.
3. **Ease of Installation:** The toolbox is easy to install and requires minimal additional dependencies beyond OpenFOAM.


# Features

`solids4foam` employs a modular design, offering generic class interfaces for solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, fluid-solid coupling methods, and solid material models. It also supports all native OpenFOAM modularity, including boundary conditions and function objects.

- Interface to Abaqus material model subroutines (UMATs)

- Mesh conversion utilities: OpenFOAM to/from Abaqus

## Tutorials

- A suite of example cases and benchmark problems to demonstrate functionality and verify performance
