Nonetheless, many of these tools have become archives rather than actively developed toolboxes.
In addition, none provide a general range of tools and features expected of for a general solids mechanics and fluid-solid interaction software.

Loking beyond purely OpenFOAM solutions, the preCICE toolbox allows OpenFOAM solvers (including solids4foam) to be coupled to a wide variety of other computational tools, including deal.ii, CalculiX, FEniCS, and code\_aster (Chourdakis, G., Schneider, D., & Uekermann, B. (2023). OpenFOAM-preCICE: Coupling OpenFOAM with External Solvers for Multi-Physics Simulations. OpenFOAM® Journal, 3, 1–25. https://doi.org/10.51560/ofj.v3.88).

Although solids4foam is one of the first general, open source solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction toolboxes based on the finite volume method, there are, of course, a number of well-known finite element codes with simular functionality (albeit based on a different numerical philosophy), such as FEniCS (Logg
et al., 2012) and deal.II (Arndt et al., 2021). In addition, domain or application specific tools such as SimVascular (Zhu et al., (2022). svFSI: A Multiphysics Package for Integrated Cardiac Modeling. Journal of Open Source Software, 7(78), 4118, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04118) and Ambit (Hirschvogel, M., (2024). Ambit – A FEniCS-based cardiovascular multi-physics solver.
