## Case Overview

An elastic plate behind a rigid cylinder is a well-known benchmark fluid-solid
interaction case proposed by Turek and Hron [1]. The geometry (Figure 1)
consists of a horizontal channel of 0.41 m in height and 2.5 m in length,
containing a rigid cylinder with a radius of 0.05 m; the centre of the cylinder
is positioned 0.2 m away from the bottom and inlet (left) boundaries of the
channel. An elastic plate of 0.35 m in length and 0.02 m in height is attached
to the right-hand side of the rigid cylinder.

Fluid enters the channel from the left-hand side with a parabolic velocity
profile. A constant pressure is imposed at the channel outlet, and a no-slip
boundary condition is applied at the walls. The fluid flow is assumed to be
laminar. The Saint Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive model with the plane strain
assumption describes the elastic plate deformation. Turek and Hron [1] examined
three variants of this case, designated `FSI1`, `FSI2` and `FSI3`: the `FSI3`
variant is considered here. The fluid and elastic plate material properties are
given in Table 1, together with the mean inlet velocity. In order to quickly
reach the periodic motion of the plate, the inlet velocity profile is applied
without a gradual increase in the mean velocity and the coupling between the
fluid and the solid is activated after 2 s.

## Expected Results

Figure 2 shows the plate deformation at the time instant when the plate tip
point (A) is at its highest position. Video 1 shows the time evolution of the
pressure field in the fluid and the displacement magnitude field in the solid.
Temporal variation in the plate tip point displacement, after the periodic
solution has been reached, is shown in Figure 3. Similarly, the temporal
variation in the total force exerted on the plate and cylinder is shown in
Figure 4. A quantitative comparison with the corresponding benchmark solutions
is given in Table 2. Mean values and amplitudes are calculated using the maximum
and the minimum values after the periodic solution has been reached (around 4 s
for the FSI3 case), where frequencies are calculated using the Fast Fourier
Transform algorithm. The difference between the calculated and the benchmark
results is around 3% in average for the amplitude and frequency of force and
displacement. The relative difference for the mean value of the force
y-component goes up to 40%, which can be attributed to the difficulty in
calculating the mean value in the case when it is close to zero.

```note
The results in Figures 3 and 4 and Table 2 were generated with the mesh and time
settings used in Tuković et al. [2], whereas Figure 2 and Video 1 were generated
using the default settings in the tutorial case.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/fluidSolidInteraction/HronTurekFsi3`. The case can be run
using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. The `Allrun` script first
executes `blockMesh` for both `solid` and `fluid` domains
(`> blockMesh -region fluid` and `> blockMesh -region solid` ), and the
`solids4foam` solver is used to run the case (`> solids4Foam`). Optionally, if
`gnuplot` is installed, a file `deflection.pdf` will be created with the
displacement history of point A and a file `force.pdf` will be created with the
history of the force on the cylinder and plate.
