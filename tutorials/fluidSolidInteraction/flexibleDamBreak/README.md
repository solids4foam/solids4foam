Prepared by Amirhossein Taran and Philip Cardiff

## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrates how to perform a multi-phase fluid-solid interaction simulation

---

## Case Overview

This case extends the traditional OpenFOAM `damBreak` tutorial to include a flexible dam. This benchmark has been examined several times in literature, including by Walhorn et al. [1], Meduri et al. [2], and Ryzhakov et al. [3]. The initial configuration of this example is shown in Figure 1, where a column of water is at rest located behind a membrane on the left side of a tank. At time $$t = 0$$, the membrane is removed, and the column of water collapses. During the collapse, the water impacts a flexible obstacle (the "dam") at the bottom of the tank, causing it to deflect elastically. For benchmarking, the horizontal displacement of the dam is tracked over time. Table 1 provides the material properties and geometry data for reference. The solid component employs a neo-Hookean large strain constitutive law. The total Lagrangian solid model (`nonLinearGeometryTotalLagrangianTotalDisplacement`) is used as the solid solver, and the volume-of-fluid incompressible multiphase fluid model (interFluid) is used as the fluid solver.

## Results

Upon starting the solution, the water column collapses due to gravity and will hit the flexible dam. Video 1 shows the time evolution of the volume-of-fluid field in the fluid domain and the displacement field in the solid domain. The `solids4foam` predictions for the deflection of the top-right corner of the dam are compared with numerical solutions from the literature in Figure 2, showing reasonable agreement. For better agreement, a mesh and time-step independence study should be performed.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at `solids4foam/tutorials/fluidSolidInteraction/flexibleDamBreak`. The case can be run using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`.  The `Allrun` script first executes `blockMesh` for both `solid` and `fluid` domains (`> blockMesh -region fluid` and `> blockMesh -region solid` ), and the `solids4foam` solver is used to run the case (`> solids4Foam`).  Optionally, if `gnuplot` is installed, the displacement history of the top-right edge of the obstacle
Optionally, to create post-processing plots, it is possible to use `solidPointDisplacement` functionObjects, which will keep track of the specified point during the solution.
