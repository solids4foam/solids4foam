Prepared by Ivan Batistić

---

## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrate how to perform a solid-only analysis in solids4foam.
- Demonstrate the performance of a solid model in a finite strain elastoplastic
  regime.

```note
A small-strain elastic version of this tutorial is also available in
solids4foam at tutorials/linearElasticity/cooksMembrane
```

## Case Overview

Cook's membrane is a well-known bending-dominated benchmark case used in linear
and non-linear analysis. The tapered panel (trapezoid) is fixed on one side and
subjected to uniform shear traction on the opposite side. The prescribed shear
traction is $$\tau = 0.3125$$ MPa. The vertices of the trapezoid (in mm) are (0,
0), (48, 44), (48, 60), and (0, 44), as shown in Figure 1. Gravitation effects
are neglected, there are no body forces, and the problem is solved as 2D using
plane strain assumption. The problem is solved as static, using 30 equally-sized
loading increments.

The material is considered elastoplastic, with the following property values:
Young's modulus $$E = 206.9$$ MPa, Poisson's ratio $$\nu=0.29$$, initial yield
stress $$\sigma_Y = 0.45$$ MPa and the hardening parameters
$$\sigma_{\infty} = 0.715$$ MPa, $$\delta = 16.93$$, $$H = 0.12924$$ MPa. The
strain hardening function is the one presented in
[[1]]((https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1620330705)):

$$
\sigma_y = \sigma_Y + (\sigma_{\infty} -
\sigma_Y)(1-\text{exp}(-\delta\varepsilon_p)) + H\varepsilon_p.
$$

## Expected results

- Around the top-left corner, the elastic body is squeezed the most (positive
  hydrostatic compression).
- The body is most stretched near the bottom side (negative hydrostatic
  compression).
- There is no known analytical solution for this problem, but results from
  various codes and procedures are available in the literature
  [[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1620330705),
  [2](http://www.simplassoftware.com/benchmarks.html),
  [3](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/438)].

Figure 2 shows the convergence of the vertical displacement in
`solids4Foam (foam-extend-4.1)` in the case of updated Lagrangian
(`nonLinGeometryUpdatedLagrangian`) and total Lagrangian
(`nonLinGeometryTotalLagrangian`) formulation. In both formulations, vertical
displacement in the top right corner tends to a value of 7.4 mm, which is close
to the values reported in
[[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1620330705),
[2](http://www.simplassoftware.com/benchmarks.html),
[3](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/438)].

In the `solids4foam` case, the vertical displacement at the top right corner is
extracted using the `solidPointDisplacement` function object placed in the
`controlDict`:

```c++
functions
{
    pointDisp
    {
        type    solidPointDisplacement;
        point   (0.048 0.060 0);
    }
}

```

The `solidPointDisplacement` function finds the mesh vertex nearest to the
specified `point` and writes the displacement of this vertex to
`postProcessing/0/solidPointDisplacement_pointDisp.dat`.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/elastoplasticity/cooksMembrane`. The case can be
run using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. In this case, the
Allrun consists of creating the mesh using `blockMesh` (`> blockMesh`) followed
by running the `solids4foam` solver (`> solids4Foam`).
