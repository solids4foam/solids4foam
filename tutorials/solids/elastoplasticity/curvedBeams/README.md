# Contact between curved beams: `curvedBeams`

Prepared by Ivan Batistić

## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrate how to perform a solid analysis with large deformations and large sliding contact.

---

## Case Overview

This example considers large sliding between two curved beams (Figure 1). The lower beam is fixed at both ends, whereas the upper beam has a prescribed horizontal displacement of $$u_x = 31.5$$ mm at both ends. Both beams are modelled as elastoplastic with isotropic hardening using the following material properties: Young’s modulus $$E = 689.56$$ MPa, Poisson’s ration $$\nu = 0.32$$, initial yield strength $$\sigma_Y = 31$$ MPa and linear hardening coefficient $$H^‘ = 261.2$$ MPa. The problem is solved using $$63$$ equal displacement increments. The frictional response is considered, and the coefficients of friction are set to $$\mu = 0.3$$. The beams are discretised using 50 cells in the circumferential and 5 cells in the radial direction. The problem is solved using the plane strain assumption, neglecting inertial and body forces.

## Expected Results

Due to its larger diameter, the lower beam exhibits greater plastic deformation during the sliding (Figure 2). Theic deformation is expected to be reduced as the coefficient of friction increases the amount of plasticity. Video 1 shows the evolution of the equivalent (von Mises) stress distribution.

Figures 3 and 4 compare the evolution of the horizontal and vertical total reaction force between `solids4foam` and results reported in the literature  [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045782515003643).  The resulting evolution of the reaction forces is smooth and matches well with results from the literature. Reported results in `solids4foam` are obtained using the updated Lagrangian formulation (`nonLinearGeometryUpdatedLagrangian`) and `foam-extend-4.1`.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at `solids4foam/tutorials/solids/elastoplasticity/curvedBeams`. The case can be run using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`.  The `Allrun` script first creates the `blockMeshDict` file using the `m4` scripting language from the `blockMeshDict.m4`  file located in `system` directory. Afterwards, `blockMesh`  (`> blockMesh`) is used to create the mesh and the `solids4foam` solver is used to run the case (`> solids4Foam`).  Optionally, if `gnuplot` is installed, the evolution of the horizontal and vertical reaction forces is plotted in the `reaction-x.png` and `reaction-y.png` files.
