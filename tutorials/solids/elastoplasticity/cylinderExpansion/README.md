Prepared by Philip Cardiff and Ivan Batistić

## Tutorial Aims

- Check solver accuracy for large-strain elastoplasticity using an available
  analytical solution.

## Case Overview

In this case, which has been analysed in Cardiff et al. [1], a thick-walled
cylinder with an inner radius $$r_i$$ of $$10$$ mm and an outer radius $$r_o$$
of $$20$$ mm is subjected to internal expansion (Figure 1). The mechanical
properties (Table 1) are chosen to approximate rigid plastic behaviour, allowing
comparison with an analytical solution. The inner radius is displaced by $$75$$
mm in the radial direction, driving the inner cylinder radius to a final value
of $$85$$ mm. A zero traction condition is applied to the outer cylinder
boundary. Inertial and body forces are neglected, and the problem is solved
using a 1-D axisymmetric mesh consisting of $$10$$ CVs in the radial direction.

## Expected Results

Assuming rigid plasticity, the radial (Cauchy) stress, $$\sigma_{rr}$$ , at the
inner surface is given analytically as [2, 3]:

$$
\sigma_{rr}=\left(\dfrac{\sigma_Y}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \ln \left(
\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{r_0}{a_0}\right)^2+\left(\dfrac{a}{a_0}\right)^2-1}{\left(\d
frac{b_0}{a_0}\right)^2 + \left(\dfrac{a}{a_0}\right)^2 -1}  \right)
$$

where $$a_0$$ is the initial inner radius, $$b_0$$ is the initial outer radius,
$$r_0$$ is the radius in the initial configuration of the material point at
which the stresses are being calculated, and $$a$$ is the current value of the
inside radius. The hoop and axial stresses are offset from the radial stress by
a constant value; consequently, only the radial stress is examined.

A comparison between numerical and analytical solutions is shown in Figure 2,
where one can see the plot of the radial (Cauchy) stress at the inner boundary
versus the current inner radius. The plot is automatically generated using
`plot.gnuplot` script when running the case using the `Allrun` script.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/elastoplasticity/cylinderExpansion`. The case can
be run using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. The `Allrun`
script first creates the `blockMeshDict` file using the `m4` scripting language
from the `blockMeshDict.m4` file located in the `system` directory. Afterwards,
`blockMesh` (`> blockMesh`) is used to create the mesh and the `solids4foam`
solver is used to run the case (`> solids4Foam`). Optionally, if `gnuplot` is
installed, the evolution of radial stress vs inner radius displacement is
plotted in the `plot.pdf` file.
