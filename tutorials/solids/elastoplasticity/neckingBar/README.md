## Case Overview

This case considers the necking of a cylinder bar subjected to uniaxial tension,
as examined in Cardiff et al. [1]. The problem geometry is shown in Figure 1 and
is represented as axisymmetric. The initial cylindrical bar radius $$r_0$$ is
$$6.413$$ mm and the initial length $$l_0$$ is $$53.334$$ mm, where there is no
initially narrowed neck region. The mechanical properties of the bar are given
in Table 1, and the hardening behaviour in Table 2.

The two end surfaces of the bar are slowly displaced through a distance of $$7$$
mm in opposite directions, where no tangential contraction of the ends is
allowed, i.e., the tangential displacement is zero. Due to symmetry, one-half of
the bar is simulated, and symmetry plane conditions are employed. The mesh
consists of $$600$$ quadrilateral cells; refinement is made near the expected
neck, similar to the setup of Simo and Hughes [2]. Gravity and transient effects
are neglected. The case is solved using $$500$$ equal loading increments.

## Expected Results

As the elongation is increased, the decrease in radius becomes strongly
non-uniform, resulting in so-called "necking". Necking begins at the maximum
load, where the increase in stress due to the decrease in the cross-sectional
area of the specimen becomes greater than the increase in the load-carrying
ability of the metal due to strain hardening [3]. The development of the necking
is shown in Figure 2.

Once the ultimate strength is surpassed and necking begins, the material's
ability to carry load diminishes rapidly. From Figure 3, one can see that for
the current case, this starts to happen after elongation reaches ~3.5 mm (250
loading step).

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/elastoplasticity/neckingBar`. The case can be run
using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. The `Allrun` script first
creates the `blockMeshDict` file using the `m4` scripting language from the
`blockMeshDict.m4` file located in the `system` directory. Afterwards,
`blockMesh` (`> blockMesh`) is used to create the mesh and the `solids4foam`
solver is used to run the case (`> solids4Foam`). Optionally, if `gnuplot` is
installed, the evolution of the force vs elongation is plotted in the
`forceElongation.png` file.
