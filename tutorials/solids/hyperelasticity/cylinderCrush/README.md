# Tutorial: `cylinderCrush`

---

## Tutorial Aims

- Exemplify the use of a hyperelastic mechanical law with large deformations
  and a solid contact boundary condition.
- Compare the convergence behavior of updated and total Lagrangian formulations.

## Case overview

**Figure 1: Solid cylinder compressed between two rigid plates**

The third benchmark is a solid cylinder made of a rubbery material crushed
between two rigid plates, as schematically shown in Figure 1. The cylinder has
a diameter of *0.4 m* and is compressed between rigid plates with a total
compressed displacement of half its diameter. The contact between the cylinder
and plate surfaces was modeled as frictionless (see the `solidContact` boundary
condition setup in the `0/DD` file).

This problem was investigated by [[1] T. Sussman and K.-J. Bathe, “A finite
element formulation for nonlinear incompresible elastic and inelastic
analysis,” Computers and Structures, vol. 26, pp. 357–409, 1987.
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794987902653), which
assumed a nearly-incompressible behavior of the material, and also by [I.
Bijelonja, I. Demirdžić, and S. Muzaferija, “A finite volume method for large
strain analysis of incompressible hyperelastic materials,” International
Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, vol.  64, pp. 1594–1609, Nov.
2005](https://hrcak.srce.hr/206941), which modeled the material of the cylinder
as purely incompressible. In the tutorial, the same material law employed by
both studies was used: the Mooney-Rivlin law with *c<sub>10</sub> = 0.293 MPa*,
*c<sub>01</sub> = 0.177 MPa*, and the bulk modulus *1410 MPa*. Note that this
material is much less stiff than the material assumed in the previous two
tutorials.

The domain used was only a quarter of the cylinder due to symmetry (hatched
area in Figure 1). A mesh with 500 quadrilateral control volumes arranged in a
block-structured mesh was simulated and the updated Lagrangian approach was
employed for the results shown below, indicated by the `solidModel`
`nonLinearGeometryUpdatedLagrangian`. The plate is linearly displaced in 30
increments.

## Expected results

Figure 2 shows the displacement of the mesh of the (a) undeformed
configuration, and an intermediate and final instants of the simulation (b and
c, respectively). Figure 3 shows the Von Mises stress field for the
intermediate and final configuration of the cylinder, where we can see that the
maximum stress occurs at the center of cylinder.

The verification of the solution given by `solids4Foam` can be seen in the
Figure 4 which shows the displacement force applied to the cylinder as a
function of the plate vertical displacement. The plot compares the numerical
solution by using the FEM solution provided by Bijelonja et al. (2005).

Note from Figures 2 and 3 that the deformation of this case is quite large,
with the mesh being considerably deformed towards the later time-steps. It is
instructive in this tutorial to assess the impact of the updated and total
Lagrangian formulations on the convergence of the case. To that end, we first
ran this tutorial with the `nonLinearGeometryUpdatedLagrangian` (label UL) and,
then, `nonLinearGeometryTotalLagrangianTotalDisplacement` (labeled TLTD) and
`nonLinearGeometryTotalLagrangian` (label TL) that uses the total Lagrangian
formulation but with the total and incremental displacements, respectively. The
comparison is shown in Figure 5 with the residuals of the second and
last time-steps.

 **Figure 5: Residuals of this tutorial using an updated and total Lagrangian
 approaches at the second (left panel) and last (right panel) time-steps.**

Note that there is a change in the best approach according to the instant in
time, although the total time of simulation was approximately the same. This
may also occur depending on the problem you simulating, so it might be
important to perform different tests with the problem you are handling to find
the optimal `solidModel`.
