## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrate the solver accuracy for a compressible linear elastic test case;
- Examine the solver performance when approaching the incompressibility limit.

## Case Overview

In this case, a homogeneous thick-wall cylindrical pressure vessel with an inner
radius $$r_i = 7$$ m, outer radius $$R_o = 18.625$$ m, and loaded internally
with pressure $$p = 100$$ MPa is analysed. The material is considered linear
elastic with Young modulus $$E=10$$ GPa and Poisson's ratio $$\nu=0.3$$. The
problem is considered plane stress, with the 2-D computational domain comprising
a quarter of the cylinder geometry. The cylinder is discretised with $$900$$
cells: $$30$$ cells in the radial and $$30$$ in the circumferential direction.
Gravitational and inertial effects are neglected, and the case is solved using
one loading increment.

## Results

The analytical solution for the stress field is [1]:

$$
\sigma_r = p \dfrac{r_i^2}{r_o^2-r_i^2}\left(1-\dfrac{r_o^2}{r^2}\right),
$$

$$
\sigma_{\theta} = p \dfrac{r_i^2}{r_o^2-r_i^2}\left(1+\dfrac{r_o^2}{r^2}\right),
$$

$$
\sigma_{z} = 0,
$$

and for radial displacement:

$$
u_r =
\dfrac{p}{E}\dfrac{r_i^2}{r_o^2-r_i^2}\left[(1-\nu)r+(1+\nu)\dfrac{r_o^2}{r}\rig
ht].
$$

Results presented in Figures 2 and 3 show numerical and analytical calculations
of radial displacement $$u_r$$, circumferential $$\sigma_{\theta}$$ and radial
$$\sigma_r$$ stress, showing good agreement. The plotting script `plot.gnuplot`
automatically generates these diagrams when running the `Allrun` script;
however, note that geometry and material properties are hardcoded in the
`plot.gnuplot` script:

```bash
Ri = 7        # Inner cylinder radius
Ro = 18.625   # Outer cylinder radius
E = 1e10      # Young modulus
p = 10e6      # Internal pressure
nu = 0.3      # Poissons ratio
```

### Approaching the Incompressibility Limit

Formulating the governing momentum balance with the displacement variable as the
only dependent variable has limitations in modelling incompressible materials.
Specifically, the formulation exhibits efficiency degradation and volumetric
locking while approaching Poisson’s ratio of $$0.5$$. An appropriate formulation
for these problems is a pressure-displacement (mixed) formulation, in which the
constitutive relation is defined via two unknowns (displacement and pressure).

From Figures 4 and 5, one can see what happens with the resulting stress field
when the displacement-based formulation is used to model nearly incompressible
material ($$\nu=0.495$$). As expected, the stress distribution exhibits
oscillatory behaviour.

Note that for the analysed case, stresses are not a function of material
properties (Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio) because of the plane stress
condition ($$\sigma_{zz}=0$$). Accordingly, the case is solved with a plane
strain assumption ($$\varepsilon_{zz}=0$$) to generate these plots.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/linearElasticity/pressurisedCylinder`. The case
can be run using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. In this case,
the `Allrun` consists of creating the mesh using `blockMesh` (`> ./blockMesh`)
followed by running the `solids4foam` solver (`> ./solids4Foam`) and
`> ./sample` utility. Optionally, if `gnuplot` is installed, the radial and
circumferential stress distribution together with the profile of radial
displacement are plotted in the `sigmaR.png`, `sigmaTheta.png` and `dispR.png`
files.

```note
The same case is solved with Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material and can be
found in the `solids/hyperelasticity/cylindricalPressureVessel`. The
hyperelastic case was initially proposed by Bijelonja et al. [2,3].
