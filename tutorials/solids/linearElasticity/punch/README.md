# Cylindrical punch with rounded edge: `punch`

---

Prepared by Philip Cardiff and Ivan Batistić

---

## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrate the solver performance when solving contact problems in small
  deformation settings;
- Demonstrate the process of meshing multiple bodies using the `cartesianMesh`
  utility.

## Case Overview

In this example, a cylindrical punch is pressed into an elastic cylindrical
foundation (Figure 1). This case is proposed as a contact mechanics benchmark by
the National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards (NAFEMS)
[[1]](https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0094/). The material
properties of the punch are similar to steel ($$E_p = 210$$ GPa,
$$\nu_p = 0.3$$), whereas the foundation has aluminium properties ($$E_f = 70$$
GPa, $$\nu_f = 0.3$$). The punch is loaded with a uniform pressure distribution
at its top surface $$p = 100$$ MPa. The bottom surface of the elastic foundation
is fixed. Friction is considered, and the coefficient of friction is set to
$$\mu=0.1$$. The problem is solved with one load increment, neglecting inertia
and gravity effects. The case can be solved using an axisymmetric computational
model; however, the setup herein considers a 3-D model with symmetries.

## Expected Results

The resulting displacement and stress fields are expected to be axisymmetric. At
the edge of the contact region, a stress peak can be expected due to the
singular pressure distribution. More precisely, the cylinder fillet radius is
too small to avoid having a geometric discontinuity causing a singular pressure
distribution. This means peak contact pressures increase at this location with
increasing mesh density; however, note that displacement fields converge to a
mesh-independent solution.

Figure 2 shows the convergence of axial displacement, radial displacement, and
contact pressure as the mesh is refined [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10736).
The `solids4foam` results match well with results reported in the literature
[[1]](https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0094/).

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/linearElasticity/punch`. The case can be run using
the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. In this case, the `Allrun`
script consists of the following steps:

- Creating the punch mesh:

  ```bash
  cp system/punch_top/meshDict system/meshDict
  solids4Foam::runApplication -s punch_top cartesianMesh
  mkdir constant/punch_top
  mv constant/polyMesh constant/punch_top/
  ```

- Creating the bottom mesh:

  ```bash
  cp system/punch_bottom/meshDict system/meshDict
  solids4Foam::runApplication -s punch_bottom cartesianMesh
  ```

- Merging two meshes (this is done because `cfMesh` cannot make meshes for
  separate bodies at once):

  ```bash
  solids4Foam::runApplication mergeMeshes . . -addRegion punch_top -noFunctionObjects
  ```

- Scaling mesh:

  ```bash
  transformPoints -scale "(0.001 0.001 0.001)" >& log.transformPoints
  ```

- Creating patches and naming them:

  ```bash
  solids4Foam::runApplication autoPatch 45 -overwrite
  solids4Foam::runApplication createPatch -overwrite
  solids4Foam::runApplication splitPatch -overwrite
  ```

- Creating cell zones for the punch and foundation (bottom region) so different
  material properties can be assigned:

  ```bash
  solids4Foam::runApplication setSet -batch batch.setSet
  solids4Foam::runApplication setsToZones
  ```

- Running the case:

  ```bash
  solids4Foam::runApplication solids4Foam
  ```
