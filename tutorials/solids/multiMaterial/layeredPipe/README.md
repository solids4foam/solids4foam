# Internally pressurised bi-material thick-walled cylinder: `layeredPipe`

---

Prepared by Željko Tukovic, Philip Cardiff and Ivan Batistić

## Tutorial Aims

- Demonstrate the solution of a multi-material solid mechanics problem;
- Compare the accuracy of a solid model against the available analytical
  solution.

## Case Overview

In this case, an internally pressurised bi-material thick-walled cylinder is
analysed (Figure 1). The problem is considered _plane stress_, with a quarter of
the domain modelled because of symmetry. The case is simulated as a steady state
using one loading step. The outside surface is modelled as stress-free, and the
left and bottom boundaries are symmetry planes. The inner bore surface has a
prescribed constant pressure $$p_i=1\times 10^5$$ Pa. The inner material (region
1 in Figure 1) has a Poisson’s ratio of $$\nu_1=0.35$$ and a Young's modulus of
$$E_1 = 20$$ GPa, while the outer material (region 2 in Figure 1) has a
Poisson’s ratio of $$\nu_2=0.3$$ and a Young's modulus of $$E_2 = 200$$ GPa;
this results in an order of magnitude difference between the Young's modulii,
i.e., $$E_2/E_1=10$$. The number of cells is set to $$120$$ circumferentially
and $$50$$ radially.

## Expected Results

Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions is performed in terms of
circumferential and radial stresses in the radial direction through the
cylinder, for which the analytical solutions are as follows [1]:

$$
\sigma_r =
\frac{r_1^2p_i-r_2^2p_{12}+(p_{12}-p_i)\left(\dfrac{r_1r_2}{r}\right)^2}{r_2^2-r
_1^2} \qquad \text{for } r_1 \leq r < r_2,
$$

$$
\sigma_r =
\frac{r_2^2p_{12}-p_{12}\left(\dfrac{r_2r_3}{r}\right)^2}{r_3^2-r_2^2} \qquad
\text{for } r_2 < r \leq r_3,
$$

$$
\sigma_{\theta} =
\frac{r_1^2p_i-r_2^2p_{12}-(p_{12}-p_i)\left(\dfrac{r_1r_2}{r}\right)^2}{r_2^2-r
_1^2} \qquad \text{for } r_1 \leq r < r_2,
$$

$$
\sigma_{\theta} =
\frac{r_2^2p_{12}+p_{12}\left(\dfrac{r_2r_3}{r}\right)^2}{r_3^2-r_2^2} \qquad
\text{for } r_2 < r \leq r_3,
$$

where the pressure at the interface, $$p_{12}$$ is given as follows:

$$
p_{12}=\dfrac{\dfrac{2r_1^2p_i}{E_1(r_2^2-r_1^2)}}{\dfrac{1}{E_2}\left(\dfrac{r_
3^2+r_2^2}{r_3^2-r_2^2}+\nu_2  \right) +
\dfrac{1}{E_1}\left(\dfrac{r_2^2+r_1^2}{r_2^2-r_1^2}-\nu_1  \right)}.
$$

Figures 2 and 3 show a comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions
of radial $$\sigma_r$$ and circumferential $$\sigma_{\theta}$$ stress
distributions. One can see that the numerical solution closely matches the
analytical one.

The plots above are created automatically within the `Allrun` script using
`sample` utility and `gnuplot`. The `transformStressToCylindrical` function
object in `system/controlDict` is used to transform the $$\sigma$$ stress tensor
from Cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical:

```c++
functions
{
    transformStressToCylindrical
    {
        type        transformStressToCylindrical;
        origin      (0 0 0);
        axis        (0 0 1);
    }
}
```

The cylindrical stresses (`sigma:Transformed`) are plotted along a
$$\theta=45^{\circ}$$ line using the `sample` utility:

```c++
fields( sigma:Transformed );

sets
(
    line
    {
        type       face;
        axis       distance;
        start      (0.0 0.0 0.0005);
        end        (0.07 0.07 0.0005);
    }
);
```

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/multiMaterial/layeredPipe`. The case can be run
using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. In this case, the
`Allrun` creates the mesh using `blockMesh` (`> blockMesh`) followed by calls to
the `setSet` and `setsToZones` utilities to create cell zones for inner and
outer cylinder materials. After that, the case is run with the `solids4Foam`
solver (`> solids4Foam`). As the last step, the `sample` utility is used to
extract data. Optionally, if `gnuplot` is installed, the radial and
circumferential stress distributions are plotted in the `sigmaR.png` and
`sigmaTheta.png` files.

```note
For multi-material cases, solids4foam expects to find a cellZone for each
material defined in constant/mechanicalProperties, where the cellZone name is
assumed to be the same as the material name in constant/mechanicalProperties.
```
