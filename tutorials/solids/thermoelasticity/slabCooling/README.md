- Demonstrate how to constrain the displacement of an internal cell using the
  `cellDisplacements` functionality.

## Case Overview

This case [1] demonstrates the process of cooling the slab from the initial
$$T_o = 800$$ K to the reference temperature, $$T_{ref} = 300$$ K. The slab is
$$6$$ m long, $$2$$ m wide, and $$1$$ m deep (shown below). The material of the
slab is linear elastic with a Young modulus of $$E = 69$$ GPa and a Poisson's
ratio of $$\nu = 0.33$$. The material density is $$\rho=7854$$ kg m$$^{-3}$$,
thermal conductivity is $$k=250$$ W m$$^{-1}$$ K$$^{-1}$$, specific heat
capacity is $$C = 434$$ J/kgK, and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion
is $$\alpha = 2.3\times 10^{-5}$$ K$$^{-1}$$. Gravity and inertia are neglected,
and the case is solved under the plane strain assumption. All slab faces are
traction-free. The slab is discretised with $$30 \times 10 \times 5$$ cells.

A steady-state solution is required, meaning the case can be solved without
temporal discretisation (using one loading increment). In this case, the values
of density, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are not important
for the resulting stress and displacement fields.

To avoid rigid-body translation, the displacement of one cell (near the centre
of the slab) is constrained to zero.

### Avoiding Rigid-Body Translations

Since a displacement value is not specified at any boundary point, the body is
unconstrained in all three directions and can freely float in space. This
results in an ill-defined steady-state problem: adding any uniform displacement
to a possible solution field will result in another valid solution field. This
is similar to incompressible fluid solvers where a pressure reference must be
supplied (`pRefValue` and `pRefCell`).

To avoid these rigid-body translations or _modes_, a displacement value should
be specified at some location in the domain. This can be done in the following
ways:

- If appropriate, employ symmetry planes;
- Set the displacement of one boundary face;
- Set the displacement of one internal cell.

All three approaches could work for this case; however, for demonstration
purposes, the third approach (Set the displacement of one internal cell) is
shown. It should also be noted that restricting rigid rotation may also be
required, but this is not shown here.

The displacement of an internal cell can be specified in the `solidProperties`
dictionary as follows:

```c++
// Set displacements of internal cells
cellDisplacements
{
    // Set displacement to zero for the cell closest to the centre of the block
    cellDisp1
    {
        approximateCoordinate    (3 1 0.5);
        displacement             (0 0 0);
    }
}
```

## Expected Results

The predicted displacement field is shown below, where the slab contracts
uniformly about its centre (where the displacement of an internal cell is
constrained).

Displacement magnitude field

As all boundaries are traction-free, the steady-state solution should be
stress-free. This is shown below, where one can see that the resulting
stress field has a magnitude of a few hundred pascals, which can be considered
negligible and is caused by the usage of iterative procedures and chosen
tolerances.

## Running the Case

The tutorial case is located at
`solids4foam/tutorials/solids/thermoelasticity/slabCooling`. The case can be run
using the included `Allrun` script, i.e. `> ./Allrun`. The `Allrun` creates the
mesh using `blockMesh` (`> blockMesh`), after which the case is run with the
`solids4Foam` solver (`> solids4Foam`).
